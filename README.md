# **Bilet_helper**
A simple script, allowing sorting exam bilets

## **Release 1.0:**
### **Pros**
1. allow read initial data from docx with fixed format
2. Randomize w/time and randint
3. store data in minimalistic .docx document
4. store not sorted data in another .docx
### **Cons**
- doesn't allow to choose themes
- it's currently killing itself when input goes wrong
- fixed format is a pain in my ass
- only allowing to choose question one time, so it isn't possible making 50 bilets w/50-questions xD
- no UI at all
- not user friendly at this point
- code is VERY raw
- works w/files in project directory

## **REQ.**
> python-docx and its dependecies

A simple script, allowing sorting exam bilets\n

Release 1.0:\n

-fixed format is a pain in my ass\n
-only allowing to choose question one time, so it isn't possible making 50 bilets w/50-questions xD\n
-no UI at all\n
-not user friendly at this point\n
-code is VERY raw\n
-works w/files in project directory\n\n
